        "# Practical 1: Hydrology\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is this notebook?\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook illustrates the importance of rainfall intensity and duration on the characteristics of hydrographs, along with the role of infiltration. Remember that hydrographs are one of the main ways we can assess fluvial flooding and then think about catchment management.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use free, open-source modelling software called [LandLab](http://landlab.github.io/) to simulate overland flow and infiltration. Note we are not simulating the existing flow in the river; just the run-off.\n",
        "\n",
        "For those that went on the rivers field trip we discussed why run-off is important in Forge Valley, so here we're going to use Forge Valley to test some of the ideas we discussed on the trip and the recorded lectures. For those that went to the coast, the recorded lectures contain everything you need to know, but feel free to chat to someone who did go to Forge Valley for why run-off is partcilarly importnat here.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What the model simulates\n",
        "\n",
        "The model is a simplified shallow water equation solver that models water flowing downhill. The base equaiton solved is:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{equation}\n",
        "\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = (P - I) - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q}\n",
        "\\end{equation}\n",
        "\n",
        "What this equation says is that the water depth, $H$, changes through time, $t$, by the precipitation rate, $P$, infiltration rate, $I$ and the water discharge, $\\mathbf{q}$, comining in and out of each grid cell. The upsidedown triangle, $\\nabla$ means take the gradient in space $(x,y)$. $\\mathbf{q}$ is calculated using:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{equation}\n",
        "\\mathbf{q} = \\frac{H^{4/3}}{n^2 U_c} \\nabla w\n",
        "\\end{equation}\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $n$ is the Manning's drag coefficient, $U_c$ is a velocity scale (here 1 m/s) and $w$ is the water surface elevation (height of the land + $H$). Finally, $I$ is calculated using:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{equation}\n",
        "I = I_c \\left( 1 - e^{-H / H_i} ) \\right)\n",
        "\\end{equation}\n",
        "\n",
        "so that we only infiltrate water when there is some surface water and these smoothly trends to 0 infiltration when there is no water on the surface. $H_i$ is a characteristic water depth (here 0.1 mm) to make sure the model is stable with very small amounts of water.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What we are going to do\n",
        "\n",
        "We are going to simulate the central section of Forge Valley in the North York Moors and see what happens during a brief, intense storm. We will then alter the infiltration rate, drag coefficient and storm intensity and duration to see how the run-off hydrology is affected by the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "No infiltration is like having hard surfaces (tarmac) or baked soil (e.g. after a wildfire). Low infiltration acts like the soil is already getting to capacity. Manning's drag alters the land surface characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The practical is in two parts. The first runs the base model with no infiltration. The second allows you to edit parameters and re-run, comparing to the original model. It's worth creating a google docs or similar to copy and paste images and make notes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (click the little \"play\" symbol on the left of a block of code).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. For example, if you change parameters but don't reset the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, then these values will not be reset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What to do..**\n",
        "\n",
        "Run each block of code once until you get to the text that says **stop here**. Then stop, and read the instrucitons carefullly! Make sure there are no errors. Ask for help if things don't work.\n",
